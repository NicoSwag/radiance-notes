Mayor of the big city on the [[Cyber Planet]], unfortunately also a Tech Bro. Not in the Elon Musk sense, but more in the "I just bought more land in the Metaverse" sense. The election system is corrupt, so no one's able to vote him out. Probably has some stupid fucking mustache. Is currently chilling in the Metaverse while the world around him is kinda falling apart. You gotta go in there and drag his ass out. Eventually you manage to kick him out and replace him with [[DJ Girl]]. Normal type user.
