Mayor of the big city on [[Cygnus]], unfortunately also a Tech Bro. Kinda Elon Musk but more the "I just bought more land in the Metaverse" type. The election system is corrupt, so no one's able to vote him out. Probably has some stupid fucking mustache. Is currently chilling in the Metaverse while the world around him is kinda falling apart. Since Cygnus is the planet responsible for the manufacturing of ARES, the inefficiency in production is a big problem. Therefore, you gotta go in there and drag his ass out. Eventually you manage to kick him out and replace him with [[Pan]] in the next elections. 

Normal type user. His signature Pokemon is Porygon-Z.
