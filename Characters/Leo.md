The rival, and [[Ari]]'s sister. She/her pronouns. Leo is trans, although probably this would not come up in the story much.

Like Ari, Leo was born in Mossdeep city, but stayed there while her sibling traveled the world, still keeping in touch with them. Leo is a computer wizard and extremely adept with all forms of technology. When Ari decided to enroll in the Mossdeep Space Program, Leo decided to apply with them, despite the lack of experience. Given the low amount of potential candidates, they were both accepted for low-stakes missions.

Leo is as smart as Ari, if not more, cheerful, caring, dependable, just a fun person to be around. She also cares very deeply for her sibling, and the feeling is mutual. However, she is also very insecure about her abilities, and does not speak up much. She usually goes along with everyone else's plans even if she disagrees.

At some point in the game, Ari will pick one of two [[Story Paths]]. Leo will pick the opposite path, and the two will end up fighting.

Leo is immune to the [[Radiance]].
