The protagonist of the game. Twin sibling of [[Leo]]. Any pronouns, but for clarity probably defaults to they/them in-game. Idk if to do anything specific with this.

Born in Mossdeep City, raised without parents, traveled the world and became an expert survivalist. They now enrolled in the Mossdeep Space Program as an astronaut.

 Air is extremely competent with practical things. They're also very smart, self-confident and trustworthy. They're protective towards her sister [[Leo]] and very fond of her. They spent a lot of time separated in the past, but they always kept in touch.
 
However, they are also prone to sarcasm and say things very roundaboutly when they have something positive to say to someone. They're also lazy but disguise it by making plans for other people to execute. This will somewhat backfire on them in the game.

Generally, Ari is a pleasant person, but they exude an aura of self-assuredness that makes it hard for people to call them out when it'd be appropriate. Overtime, this leads to interpersonal friction with people that they care about, especially their sister. 

At some point in the game, you will need to pick one of two[[ Story Paths]]. Leo will pick the opposite path, and you will need to fight each other.

Ari is immune to the [[Radiance]].

Name origin: Aries (The sign)
