De-Facto Leader of the [[Swamp Planet]] No one knows of his real appearance, as he is wearing a hooded robe at all times. Probably looks weird idk. Runs a cult of disenfranchised people and criminals that were exiled in the shithole planet. He believes that the Radiance is a blessing, not a curse, and that only by harnessing its power humanity will be able to move forward. He has learned that, under some circumstances, the Radiance can transform people and Pokemon, and is interested in learning how to do this. You are able to side with him or against him. Ghost type user.
