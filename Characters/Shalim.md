De-Facto Leader of [[Veles]]. No one knows of his real appearance, as he is wearing a hooded robe at all times. Probably looks weird idk. Religious leader on the Planet, he believes that the Radiance has the potential to be a blessing, and that only by harnessing its power humanity will be able to move forward. He is interested in learning if the destructive power of the Radiance can instead be utilized to transcend humanity, and he will learn that it is just so: under certain circumstances, humans and Pokemon are able to transform into Ultra Beasts.

In the Law Path, he sternly opposes your goal to get rid of the Radiance. In the Chaos path you side with him, and eventually his wish is granted and he ascends into his new form: Blacephalon. Thanks to his power, he allows you to reach Necrozma: unfortunately he then succumbs to madness, attacking you.

Ghost type user: his signature Pokemon is Spiritomb.
