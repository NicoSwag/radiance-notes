Follower of the cult led by [[Cultist of the Swamp]]. Probably also a weird twink. Originally wasn't into it and joined the cult to destroy it from inside, but comes to genuinely believe in their goals over time. If you join their side, he can help you gain the favor of the Cultist. If you side against them he fights you, purposefully expose himself to the radiance and turns into an Ultra Beast (probably Nihilego). Poison type user,
