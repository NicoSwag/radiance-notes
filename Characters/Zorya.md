The empress of the last standing civilization of [[Djet]]. Royal-looking lady. Strict, but effective, ruler. [[Marsa]], the capital city of the planet, is by far the most prosperous city still standing in the Solar System thanks to her reign. However, she imprisons suspected dissidents or even those who believe to have been in contact with the Radiance. She believe that the Radiance must be destroyed at all costs. After the radiance is gone, her goal is to sweep in and conquer what remains of the human civilization, to start a new era for her empire.

 You can choose to side with her, or against her. In the Law path, she eventually sacrifices herself in the end to allow you to destroy the Radiance, and turns into Pheromosa. In the Chaos path, her daughter [[Nikola]] turns into an Ultra Beast instead, driving her to madness.
 Bug-type user: her signature Pokemon is Volcarona.
