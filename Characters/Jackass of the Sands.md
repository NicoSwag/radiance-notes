Daughter of the [[Ruler of the Sands]] and next in line as ruler. A free spirit, she's not too fond of her mother, or of much of anyone. She generally antagonizes you in your journey in the [[Sand Planet]], but ultimately grows fond of you. While disagreeing with her mother, she also believes that getting rid of the Radiance is the only path forward for humanity. If you side with them, she assists you in convincing her mother to join your cause. If you side against them, she is enraged and vows to stop you with any means necessary. She ends up being exposed to the Radiance and turns into an Ultra Beast (probably Kartana). Grass type user.
