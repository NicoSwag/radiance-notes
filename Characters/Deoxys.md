Deoxys is the result of [[Dr. Jena]] experimenting with trying to find a cure for the [[Radiance]]. It was born from a Colony of Ditto cells, injected with Ari's DNA and then exposed to the Radiance, which then quickly multiplied and gained sentience. While [[Necrozma]] desires to consume, Deoxys is not naturally malignant. Unfortunately, its mistreatment by Dr Jena during the experiments lead to it seeking revenge. It is highly cunning and, while not possessing full sapience, it is able to imitate not only pokemon, but also human beings. It is currently locked in the depths of the [[Crepitus Space Station]], but escapes at some point in the story.
