It is said that Necrozma is a being that emerged from beyond the event horizon of a black hole at the center of the galaxy. Its only aim is to consume; and the more it consumes, the more it shines bright. It is a force of nature more than a living being, although after having consumed the life force of billions it has started developing something that could be called a consciousness. And it is screaming.

Necrozma, sensing the lifeforce of humanity and Pokemon alike, traveled to the [[Solar System]], crash landing on the [[Moon]], before starting to emit the [[Radiance]].

At the same time as the birth of Necrozma, the original entity that would later be known as [[Cosmog]] also came to existence.
