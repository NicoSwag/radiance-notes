Queen of the Capital City of [[Goetia]]. She's sweet and loving to all her subjects. She also strongly believes in the tradition of her people, and is very wary about outsiders. She has a giant chocolate fountain in the middle of her city which, unknowingly, is actually an ancient weapon of destruction. [[Zorya]] wants the weapon to modify it and integrate it with [[ARES]] and turn it into an anti-radiance weapon. Purna will need some convincing, and will make you work for it.

Fairy-type trainer, her signature Pokemon is Ribombee.
