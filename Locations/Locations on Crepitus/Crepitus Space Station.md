Space station orbiting around a gas giant called Crepitus. Very low orbit, and the atmosphere is breathable, so it's more like a open-air floating platform. It is not anchored to the planet itself, though. It is multi-level. Some people here are running experiments with the virus. [[Dr. Jena]] is the head scientist on this station, and she's hiding a terrible secret.

Sublocation:

Top level - Living quarters
Middle level - energy and plumbing
Bottom level - Research area, with terrarium and aquarium.
Secret level - biological containment area. [[Deoxys]]' chamber.
