Large portions of the planets are completely mechanized, bit reminiscent of Deltarune's cyber world. Main city is huge, with electric billboards everywhere, bit similar to New Pork City in mother 3. [[Seth]] is the corrupt mayor of its capital, New Basa City, while [[Ran]] is a DJ and leader of a revolutionary movement.

Name origin: So this is a bit roundabout. Obviously it's from Deneb, brightest star in the Cygnus constellation. I got to here because in greek mythology Cygnus (or Cycnus) was the wife of Phaethon, son of Helios, who was very shit at his job (also similar root as photon). Phaethon is a mouthful, and there's already a lot of planet with greek and latin names, so Deneb it is (also derives from the Arabic for "tail").
