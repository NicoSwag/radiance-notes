ARES (Anti-Radiance Emitter Shield) is a technology invented through a collaboration between all planets in the Solar System as a last-ditch effort to halt the [[Radiance]]. It works by emitting a particular frequency that counteracts the radiance. However, it is also extremely difficult and costly to implement. Material from all planets is needed, as well as the conjoined effort of human and Pokemon, and with manned space travel becoming impossible and cooperation breaking down, it is extremely difficult to manufacture more.

During the story, the ARES technology will be utilized in several ways. [[Professor Thale]] is trying to develop a suit that can shield from the Radiance, although it does not work very well. [[Zorya]] will be trying to obtain an ancient weapon on [[Goetia]] that can turn ARES into a weapon, piercing the barrier on the [[Moon]]. [[Shalim]], instead, will ail to modify ARES so that it does the opposite of what it is meant to do: it will instead subject people and Pokemon to controlled burst of the Radiance, ensuring their transformation into [[Ultra Beasts]].
