*Green, animated dream background. Ari slowly appears on the scene, like the professor in the regular intro.*
**Ari:**
Where... Am I...?
...
Oh, right. That dream again...
It always starts out like this...
I'm looking at myself, and then...
That voice...

**Mysterious Voice:**
...
Young human...
Will you heed my call...?
The time... Is now at hand...
Tell me... Do you know yourself...?

**Ari:**
Know myself...?
Of course. I'm...

*Naming screen shows up.*
*Afterwards, Ari fades out and the screen shows Leo.*

**Mysterious Voice:**
And this one...
You know her too, do you not...?

**Ari:**
That's... Of course I do.
That's my twin sister.
Her name is...

*Naming screen shows up.*
*Ari comes back on the screen.*

**Mysterious Voice:**
Yes...
Two souls, set for greater things...
The destiny that has been set out for you is fast approaching.
But what you do with it... Is up to you.
Your path... Your choices...
Endless possibility awaits.

*Ari fades out, a black outline of Cosmon fades in.*

**Ari:**
!!!
This is new.
The dream always ends before this.

**Mysterious Voice:**
Young human...
I must now bid you farewell...
We are looking forward to meeting you...
But then again... 
We have already met.

*Scene switches out to Ari.*

**Ari:**
Wait, no! Don't go!
Who are you?
And what do you mean by all of that?
Waaaaaait!

*Player shrink down sequence.*
*Ari wakes up in their bed.*

**Ari:**
Yaaawn.... 
Well, that was some dream.
What was it again? I can't quite remember.
I really should keep a dream journal, or something.
...
Oh, crap!
I'm late! Today, of all days!
Leo! Where's Leo?
This time she's really gonna kill me!
I better get dressed and find her!

*Brief fade to black, player is dressed and out of bed.*
*Player goes downstairs, there's a note on the table.*

**Ari:**
A note!
It must be from Leo.

**Letter:**
Dearest sibling,
As my valiant efforts of getting your lazy posterior out of bed have been in vain, I have taken the liberty of heading to the location of our scheduled meeting.
As soon as this missive reaches you... 
Prithee get your ass to the Space Center immediately!!!
-Leo

**Ari:**
Whoops...
I better go there right away.
But then again, I should say goodbye to the neighbors first.
I won't be back for a while, after all.
I'm sure the professor won't mind a little delay.
