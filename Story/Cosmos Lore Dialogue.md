This would play midway through the game. I am writing it down as a sort of "lore bible" of what things would be communicated to the player eventually.

**Mysterious Voice**
We have been waiting for you.
The time we have at our disposal is brief.
Ask, and we will answer.

**Ari**
Who are you?

**Mysterious Voice**
We are the voice of the Cosmos.
We are you, and you are us.
And yet we are not you, and you are not us.

**Ari**
Are you... God?

**Mysterious Voice**
We are no more God than you are.

**Ari**
What happened to the world?

**Mysterious Voice**
One day, the Radiance emerged from a black hole, hungering to destroy.
The Universe shuddered, and birthed a being to fight it.
But it was not enough.
The being was destroyed, and split into many pieces.
The Radiance, itself, was heavily wounded.
It sensed your world, full of life and energy.
And strived to absorb it all.

**Ari**
What about the being?

**Mysterious Voice**
The being was torn apart, but not dead.
Two of its pieces maintained a consciousness.
They saw the Radiance heading to your world.
With the power they had left, they opened a portal to it, so that they could warn its people.

**Ari**
Was the being Cosmog?

**Mysterious Voice**
In a way.
Those you call Cosmog are the being. But they will never be the being again.
Those you call Cosmog are us. But they will never be us again.
We are you, and we are Cosmog. 
But you are not us, and Cosmog is not us.
When the two Cosmog fell on Earth, you found them, weakened.
Were it not for you, they would have perished.
You nursed them, and they entered a deep, grateful sleep.
Once they awakened, they were to warn the world of the calamity.
But your scientists did not understand.
They used them to make an engine.

**Ari**
What happened on the spaceship?

**Mysterious Voice**
You found the Cosmog as they finally awakened from their sleep.
They saw you, on a collision course with the Radiance.
They tried to save you. You struggled.
The engine overcharged, and your craft traveled forward in space-time.

**Ari**
Is all of this... Our fault?

**Mysterious Voice**
There is no fault.
Cosmog came to warn humanity. Humanity did not listen.
But we cannot see a path where events go otherwise.
A lot has been lost. But not all is lost yet.
You and your sister were chosen by the Cosmog.
By us. 
And now, you are the key.

**Ari**
Why us?

**Mysterious Voice**
The question is meaningless.
All that happens is what must happen.
We have foreseen that it is to be you, and so it is.
Now... 
Listen closely, for our time is running out.

In this future, you have gathered the pieces of the Cosmog that had broken off.
They arrived here, now, carried by the Radiance.
A little earlier, and they would not have been here.
A little later, and they would have been consumed.
But now, here, is the time.
The Cosmog will soon unleash its true power.
They will become something new.
Something that is not us, and was never us, and will never be us again.
You and your sister will be called to make a choice.
We do not know what will be. Only you do.

Follow your path to the end, and never look back.
