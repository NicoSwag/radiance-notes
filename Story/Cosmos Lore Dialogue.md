This would play midway through the game. I am writing it down now as a sort of reminder of what things would be communicated to the player eventually.

**Mysterious Voice**
We have been waiting for you.
The time we have at our disposal is brief.
Ask, and we will answer.

**Ari**
Are you the one from my dreams?

**Mysterious Voice**
We are the voice of the Cosmos.
We are you, and you are us.
And yet we are not you, and you are not us.

**Ari**
Are you... God?

**Mysterious Voice**
We are no more God than you are.

**Ari**
What happened to the world?

**Mysterious Voice**
One day, the Radiance emerged beyond the place where light cannot escape.
It hungered to consume.
The Universe shuddered, and birthed a being to fight it.
But it was not enough.
The being was destroyed, and split into many pieces.
The Radiance, however, was heavily wounded.
It sensed your world, full of life and energy.
And strived to absorb it all.

**Ari**
What about the being?

**Mysterious Voice**
The being was torn apart, but not dead.
Two of its pieces maintained a consciousness.
They saw the Radiance heading to your world.
With the power they had left, they opened a portal to it, so that they could warn its people.

**Ari**
Was the being Cosmog? Are you Cosmog?

**Mysterious Voice**
In a way.
Those you call Cosmog are the being. But they will never be the being again.
Those you call Cosmog are us. But they will never be us again.
We are you, and we are Cosmog. 
But you are not us, and Cosmog is not us.
When the two Cosmog fell on your planet, you found them, weakened.
Were it not for you, they would have perished.
You nursed them, and they entered a deep, grateful sleep.
Once they awakened, they were to warn the world of the calamity.
But your scientists did not understand.
They used their power to create an engine.
The engine of the craft that brought you here.

**Ari**
What happened on the spaceship?

**Mysterious Voice**
You were reunited with the Cosmog, as they finally awakened.
They saw you, on a collision course with the Radiance.
They tried to save you. You struggled.
Cause. Effect.
The engine overcharged, and your craft traveled forward in space-time.

**Ari**
Is all of this... Our fault?

**Mysterious Voice**
There is no fault.
The Cosmog came to warn humanity. Humanity did not listen.
We cannot see a different path. It was not to be.
A lot has been lost. But not all is lost yet.
You and your sister were chosen.
Brought here to fulfill a purpose.
By the Cosmog.
By us.
By yourselves.

**Ari**
Why were we chosen?

**Mysterious Voice**
A meaningless question.
All that happens is what must happen.
We have foreseen it, and so it is.
Any conclusion is yours to make.

**Ari**
What happens now?

**Mysterious Voice**
You have been gathering the pieces of the original being that had broken off.
They arrived here, now, carried by the Radiance.
A little earlier, and they would not have been here.
A little later, and they would have been consumed by the corruption.
What is transpiring can only happen here and now.
The two Cosmog have regained their power, and will soon start incubating.
Each a cosmic egg, full of possibilities.
They cannot be whole again, but they can become something new.
Something that is not us, and was never us, and will never be us again.
You and your sister will be called to make a choice.
In the planet of sands, lies an altar of the Sun.
In the planet of swamps, lies an altar of the Moon.
You will choose, and a new future will open itself.
You will discover who your friends are.
You will discover who your enemies are.
And you will discover who you are.
Follow your path to the end, and never look back.
And now, young human...
It is time for you to awaken.
What was to be said, has been said.
Nothing more.
Nothing less.

**Ari**
Will I ever speak to you again?

**Mysterious Voice**
Speak to yourself, and we will listen.
Speak to the world, and we will listen.
