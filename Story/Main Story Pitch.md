Pokemon Radiance is an open planet-hopping adventure through space with the ultimate goal of dealing with the source of the [[Radiance]], a mysterious energy that's threatening humanity and Pokemon alike with extinction. How you decide to save everyone, however, is up to you.

A pair of twin astronauts[^1] go on a mission to check out a mysterious object that is heading towards the solar system, an due to a mishap end up in the future. In this time, humanity has spread throughout the solar system, bringing Pokemon with them and building new civilizations. But now a deadly force threatens everything: the Radiance. 

Not long before the events of the game, a mysterious space organism ([[Necrozma]]) crashed into the moon and started emitting a blinding light, making the satellite appear like a second Sun in the sky. Continued exposure to this radiation, the Radiance, causes both human and Pokemon to behave extremely aggressive and slowly sapping their life forces, eventually turning them to husks. Instead of withering, however, some creatures seem to mutate in even stronger, but mindless and grotesque, lifeform: the [[Ultra Beasts]]. While the Radiance is associated with light, it is a different type of radiation, and able to penetrate through shielding,

Through never-before seen cooperation, the various planets in the Solar System managed to develop a shielding technology to counteract the Radiance: a device known as [[ARES]] (Anti-Radiance Emitter Shield). Unfortunately, this was too little, too late. Earth fell, turning into a frozen wasteland. Space travel became effectively impossible, and the portion of humanity that did not succumb to madness or to the attacks of crazed Pokemon has started living in isolated and well-defended fortresses on each planet. Now, people can do nothing but fruitlessly struggle trying to find a solution, accept their fate or even work to hasten the spread of the Radiance in an almost religious frenzy.

The protagonists have mysteriously traveled into this future world from the past, and they discover that they are seemingly unaffected by the Radiance. After meeting and saving a couple of strange Pokemon ([[Cosmog]]) that have the power to travel through space, the twin astronauts set on a journey through space to unite the divided humanity and find a way to deal with the Radiance once and for all.
