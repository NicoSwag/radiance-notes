Midway through the game, the player will need to choose one of two story paths, which change certain events in the latter half of the game. Some storylines will remain similar, while others will be drastically changed. Both paths are meant to be imperfect and morally grey.

In the Order path, the player will side with [[Zorya]], working to rid the world of the [[Radiance]]. However, the result will be that her Empire, now commanded by her daughter [[Nikola]], will govern the [[Solar System]] with an iron fist, creating order at the cost of oppression.

In the Chaos path, the player will side with [[Shalim]] and [[Blaise]], working to find a way to harness the power of the radiance. The ending will involve all willing lifeforms being transformed in new beings over time, the [[Ultra Beasts]]. They are intelligent and will be able to create a new, perhaps better, civilization, but everything that came before will be abandoned. Not everyone will choose to become an Ultra Beast, but eventually humanity and Pokemon alike will be replace by something else.

No matter what path [[Ari]] chooses, [[Leo]] will side with the opposite. In the final battle, Leo's legendary Pokemon will fuse with [[Necrozma]] as a desperate gambit to defeat you. What happens to them after depends on the path.
