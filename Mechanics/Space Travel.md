Space will be a sort of hub area for all the planets you can land in. This will be done by modifying the Latios/Latias soaring branch, but with Cosmog/Solgaleo/Lunala instead.

The player will not be able to access all the planets from the start. If possible, they should be physically limited from reaching faraway planets by reducing the boundaries of the map, but if not possible then just not setting the visited location flag is fine. As the player gathers more  [[Cosmog Piece]], the player will be able to get to further planets.

Landing on a planet puts you in a specific location, but you can leave a planet from anywhere that's not an enclosed space.
