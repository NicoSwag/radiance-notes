There's three types of crafting materials. (also see [[Crafting System]])

**Chips**
Can be purchased with currency at a 3d printer. Used as generic crafting material.

**Pokemon Parts**
Dropped from defeated Pokemon. Similar to the Scarlet/Violet ones. Used in crafting, but can also be recycled for some matter. 

**Scrap**
Found around the place. The only purpose is to be sold for a large amount of Matter. Effectively serve the same function as nuggets.
