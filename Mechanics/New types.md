Two types have been added in the game: the Stellar type and the Sound type. Stellar does NOT act like in Scarlet and Violet, but is a proper type. Here's the tentative properties of each type:

**Stellar**
Special type

1.5x[^1] against Fairy, Fire
0.5x to Ice, Rock
0x to Sound

1.5x from Ice, Rock
0.5x from Ghost, Dark, Fairy, Flying
0x from Sound

**Sound**
Special type

1.5x to Water, Steel, Ground
0.5x to Psychic, Ice, Grass, Bug, 0x to Stellar

1.5 from Psychic, Electric, Poison
0.5x from Ground, Steel
0x from Stellar


The rest of the types are unchanged, with the exception of **Dark** which is now a **Physical** type.

[^1]: Now the standard supereffective multiplier. See [[Battle Engine Modifications]].
