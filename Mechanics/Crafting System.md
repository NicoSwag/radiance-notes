Throughout the world, you will find cutting-edge 3D printing machines. These will allow you to do three things:

- Recycle [[Materials]] to get Matter, the main currency of the game. This is the main way to get currency, as Trainers don't give it out (at least initially).
- Use Matter to make simple items, mainly Poke Ball, Medicine or Chips (a required crafting material for many recipes)
- Craft more complicated recipes by combining Materials.

Recipes will need to be unlocked by finding Blueprints. These can be obtained from the field or from completing quests and sidequests. Craftable items will mostly consist of TMs and held items.

There might be multiple versions of recipes with different, similar item types. Just be careful to not bloat too much, but also make sure that it's not too hard to actually get something crafted.
