Throughout the world, you will encounter obstacles blocking your path. HMs do not exist, however; instead, you will use your Pokemon's own moves.

Each move might be assigned a certain category, as well as a strength. A move can interact with obstacles of certain categories and tiers based on its strength. To make things less frustrating, Pokemon will be able to relearn levelup moves at any time (this will not replenish the PP, however, and TMs will need to be retaught). Moves will say what field effect they have in the description.

Wild Pokemon are somewhat weakened by the Radiance, and therefore are not able to use all these field moves from the start. As you gain Cosmog Pieces, the influence of Cosmog on your party grows, and you unlock the usage of new field moves.

The field move categories are as follows:

**Shake**
Full-body attacks above a certain power, like headbutt, or double edge. Can shake trees and make Pokemon or berries fall out. One tier.

**Burn**
Fire moves. Can burn dry wood and generally flammable-looking objects. Three different tiers.

**Cut**
Slashing moves. More than cutting trees, I think it'd be more appropriate to have this cutting other kinds of obstacles such as cobwebs, fences or similar. Two different tiers.

**Grapple**
Can create bridges with vines, silk, or similar. One tier.

**Light**
Moves that would light up the place. Works like flash. One tier.

**Break**
Generally punching or kicking moves, but stuff like explosion also works. Breaks brittle rocks and walls. Two tiers.

**Push**
Conceptually a bit iffy, but moves that *move* things rather than *break* them. Would be for strength puzzles, but also bigger boulders to simply push into holes. Two tiers.

**Surf**
Surf obviously, but even stuff like aqua jet or waterfall. Only surfs on water, though, can't go up on waterfalls. One tier.

**Climb**
Moves that have to do with speed, climbing, or athleticism. Just works like rock climb. One tier.

**Escape**
Teleporting moves, fly, etc. Teleport to the last healing spot the player has visited. One tier.

**Energize**
Energy-related moves. Used to give power to contraptions. Two tiers.

**Dig**
Moves related to digging, terraforming, claws, drills. Digs up buried items: is effectively a replacement for hidden items. Similar idea to Beans in the Mario & Luigi series. One tier.
