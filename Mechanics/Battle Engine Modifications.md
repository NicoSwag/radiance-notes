To deal with the semi open-world nature of the game, several changes have been made to the battle system.

- Stat calculation uses the Pokemon Legends Arceus formula
- Damage calculation uses the Pokemon Legends Arceus formula with reduced damage.
- EVs are now 0 to 100 in every stat, have no limits (can be maxed out in all stats) and give a boost to a stat in increments of 10 similarly to how Legends Arceus does it, but with a weaker multiplier. IVs only determine the starting amount of EVs in each stat (0 to 31), and otherwise do nothing. EVs are gained in the same way as the vanilla games.
- There is no physical-special split. See [[New types]] for more information on which types are physical and which are special.
- Explosion works like pre gen 5.
- After a Pokemon faints, sending the next one happens immediately, and not at the end of the turn. Basically gen 3 mechanics.
- Supereffective move now only do 1.5x damage. Resisted moves aren't changed.
- Freeze is now frostbite
- Sleeping Pokemon wake up when hit (to be implemented)
- Many moves have been cut, changed or added (to be implemented).
- Pokemon only gain experience at the end of a battle. In order to simplify the handling of the EXP distribution, all members of the party gain EXP at the end of the battle.[^1]
- Outside of explicitly friendly fights with your rival or allied characters, wiping = game over. See the [[Saving]] page for more information.
- Running away will be way harder unless you're at a significantly higher level than the wild pokemon.
- There is NO gimmicks like megas, dynamax, nothing. Fuck you.
- Catching a Pokemon lets you put it in your team right away.
- Misty Terrain no longer weakens dragon, and boosts fairy moves by 1.3.

[^1]: Should fainted Pokemon gain EXP? If so, they should not be revived on levelup.
