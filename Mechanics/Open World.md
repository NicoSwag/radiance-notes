The game will be semi-open world, in the sense that progression through areas will be generally up to the player, but not every path will be available from the start. More leaning Dark Souls world design, so to speak. Areas should loop on each other, and some paths might be blocked off by obstacles (see [[Ranger-Style Field Moves]]). There will be either no scaling or very minor scaling, as hopefully the overhauled battle system evens the playing field a bit. There will be a lot of backtracking but a lot of different ways to get to places, so it should not be tedious.
